# Component-Based Modeling with Ordinary Differential Equations

## Copy-Paste Example

Here is the complete example, with explanation to follow:

```julia
using ModelingToolkit, OrdinaryDiffEq

@parameters t σ ρ β
@variables x(t) y(t) z(t)
D = Differential(t)

eqs = [D(x) ~ σ*(y-x),
       D(y) ~ x*(ρ-z)-y,
       D(z) ~ x*y - β*z]

lorenz1 = ODESystem(eqs,name=:lorenz1)
lorenz2 = ODESystem(eqs,name=:lorenz2)

@variables a
@parameters γ
connections = [0 ~ lorenz1.x + lorenz2.y + a*γ]
connected = ODESystem(connections,t,[a],[γ],systems=[lorenz1,lorenz2])

u0 = [lorenz1.x => 1.0,
      lorenz1.y => 0.0,
      lorenz1.z => 0.0,
      lorenz2.x => 0.0,
      lorenz2.y => 1.0,
      lorenz2.z => 0.0,
      a => 2.0]

p  = [lorenz1.σ => 10.0,
      lorenz1.ρ => 28.0,
      lorenz1.β => 8/3,
      lorenz2.σ => 10.0,
      lorenz2.ρ => 28.0,
      lorenz2.β => 8/3,
      γ => 2.0]

tspan = (0.0,100.0)
prob = ODEProblem(connected,u0,tspan,p)
sol = solve(prob,Rodas5())

using Plots; plot(sol,vars=(a,lorenz1.x,lorenz2.z))
```

## Generating ODESystems

First let's build an ODE model. To do this we start by defining some
variables. In a differential equation system, we need to differentiate
between our (dependent) variables and parameters. Therefore, we label
them as follows:

```julia
using ModelingToolkit

@parameters t σ ρ β
@variables x(t) y(t) z(t)
D = Differential(t)
```

Then we build the system:

```julia
eqs = [D(x) ~ σ*(y-x),
       D(y) ~ x*(ρ-z)-y,
       D(z) ~ x*y - β*z]
```

Each operation builds an `Term` type, and thus `eqs` is an array of
`Term` and `Sym`s (possibly wrapped in Num). This holds a tree of the full system that can be
analyzed by other programs. We can turn this into a `ODESystem` via:

```julia
sys = ODESystem(eqs)
```

This `ODESystem` can then be used to generate an `ODEProblem` by supplying the
constructor with a map from the states of the system to their initial condition
values and from the parameters of the system to their values. For example:

```julia
u0 = [x => 1.0
      y => 0.0
      z => 0.0]

p  = [σ => 10.0
      ρ => 28.0
      β => 8/3]
tspan = (0.0,100.0)
prob = ODEProblem(sys,u0,tspan,p;jac=true,sparse=true)
```

Note that the additional `jac=true` tells the system to symbolically generate
an optimized Jacobian function to enhance the differential equation solvers,
and `sparse` tells it to build the ODEProblem with all of the enhancements
setup for sparse Jacobians.

## Building Component-Based Models

Now let's use ModelingToolkit to start building component-based models.
Component-based models are compositions between submodels. This allows
one to keep independently generated libraries of components intact
and use them as the building blocks to construct more complicated
models.

Let's define two interacting Lorenz equations. To do this, we will
build two `ODESystem`s from the equations we used in the first part:

```julia
lorenz1 = ODESystem(eqs,name=:lorenz1)
lorenz2 = ODESystem(eqs,name=:lorenz2)
```

Now let's define an interconnection between these ODE systems. Here
we will define a new variable `α` which is defined by the interplay
between these two models:

```julia
@variables a(t)
@parameters γ
connections = [0 ~ lorenz1.x + lorenz2.y + a*γ]
connected = ODESystem(connections,t,[a],[γ],systems=[lorenz1,lorenz2])
```

This `ODESystem` thus connects the two Lorenz systems and defines the
dynamics of `α` according to the continuous algebraic equation, thus
this is now a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) of 7 variables.
We can then define the resulting `ODEProblem` and send it over to
DifferentialEquations.jl:

```julia
u0 = [lorenz1.x => 1.0,
      lorenz1.y => 0.0,
      lorenz1.z => 0.0,
      lorenz2.x => 0.0,
      lorenz2.y => 1.0,
      lorenz2.z => 0.0,
      a => 2.0]

p  = [lorenz1.σ => 10.0,
      lorenz1.ρ => 28.0,
      lorenz1.β => 8/3,
      lorenz2.σ => 10.0,
      lorenz2.ρ => 28.0,
      lorenz2.β => 8/3,
      γ => 2.0]

tspan = (0.0,100.0)
prob = ODEProblem(connected,u0,tspan,p)
sol = solve(prob,Rodas5())

using Plots; plot(sol,vars=(a,lorenz1.x,lorenz2.z))
```
